## Architecture

- Patients partitioned by region
- Strong consistency for medical records (MongoDB)
- Eventual consistency for real-time data (Cassandra, InfluxDB)
- Replication implemented for high availability
- Fault tolerance achieved via simulation

## Fault Tolerance
Simulate node failures and test recovery using Docker or command-line tools.
